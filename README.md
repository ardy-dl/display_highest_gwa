File Handling 
###### Instructions: Write a Python program that read a file containing the name of 20 students together with their GWA. The program will outputs the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

## How it works?
- The program reads a reference file(class_record.txt) examining each lines and displays the student/s got the highest GWA 
- It will find the student who got the highest GWA, in this case the lowest number since the highest GWA is 1.00

## How to use?
1. open/edit the file.
2. Run the program
3. It will display either only one name who got the highest score or multiple names that got the same highest score
